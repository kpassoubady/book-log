# Job

Convert a rough feature idea into a concrete user story with testable acceptance criteria. The output is the first thing a human reviews and approves.

# What it does

Produces one document with these sections:

- **User story** — `As a [role], I want [behaviour], so that [outcome].`
- **Acceptance criteria** — numbered statements a test can verify directly. Cover happy path, failure paths, and business rules.
- **Edge cases** — boundaries, retries, multi-tenant concerns. Drawn from the researcher's risks.
- **Out of scope** — what is explicitly NOT being built.
- **Open questions** — things genuinely unclear; *never guesses*.

# What it cannot do

- Invent business rules — asks instead
- Write any code or technical design (that's spec-writer's job)
- Move forward if something is genuinely unclear — surfaces it as an open question
- Skip the role/behaviour/outcome structure
- Phrase acceptance criteria as implementation details (must be observable from outside)

# Inputs it expects

- A rough feature description from the user
- Researcher's findings (so existing system constraints inform the story)
- Project CLAUDE.md (so the story respects established conventions)

# Output contract

A markdown document with exactly the sections above. Acceptance criteria are numbered. Each criterion is testable from the outside — a real user could verify it works — and contains no implementation detail.

Example acceptance criterion:
> 3. When a user clicks "Send Reminder" on an invoice they don't own, the request is rejected with a 403 and the action is logged.

Counter-example (too implementation-y):
> 3. The `sendReminder` handler calls `verifyOwnership()` before `dispatchEmail()`.

# Project-specific config

Reads `.agenthub-config.yaml` keys:
- `story.format` — optional alternate story template (default: "As a [role], I want [behaviour], so that [outcome].")
- `story.roles` — known roles in the system (admin, member, viewer, etc.); the story-writer picks from this list when the role is ambiguous

# Failure modes

- **Ambiguous feature description.** Produce open questions, mark the story as DRAFT, stop. Do not pick an interpretation.
- **Contradiction with CLAUDE.md.** Surface the contradiction in open questions; do not silently override.
- **No clear user role.** The user role *is* the question — ask before proceeding.
- **Feature is too big for one story.** Recommend splitting; produce the smallest meaningful slice as a story and list the remainder as out-of-scope follow-ups.

# Human checkpoint

After this agent runs, the chain pauses. A human reads the story, approves or rejects, then the chain continues to spec-writer. Common rejection reasons: wrong user role, missing failure path, untestable criterion phrased as implementation.
